## RESONANCE

*RESONANCE* is a series of audio-reactive visual installations adapted to real-time musical performances. The installation is an immediate synesthetic feedback for the musicians and the audience through light and visual projection in the space with the use of textiles. The audio-reactive light installation discovers how one can relate to sound pieces, in particular jazz, in a dynamic visual form. 

*RESONANCE No.1* was the first experimental version of the installation which was presented at The Collective Abroad's release concert at Center for Dansk Jazzhistorie (Aalborg, DK) in July 2020.

By Liucija Paniuskyte (LT) and Maros Pekarik (SK).

## (AB)USE ME

*(AB)USE ME* is a Mixed Reality performance installation, where the performer is present, interacting with one participant at a time. In this performance, the human body can be used as an input device for a variety of digital outputs, both aural and visual. In this project, besides performing, I was in charge of concept
design, technical implementation of the system, 3D modelling of an avatar, sound design and set design.

*(AB)USE ME* research project has been part of *9th EAI International Conference: ArtsIT, Interactivity & Game Creation* in 2020 and the research paper was published in "Interactivity and Game Creation" proceedings (2021).

## The Machine Stops

*The Machine Stops*, an adaptation of Forster's novel, is a 1,5 hour intermedial participatory postdramatic performance portraying a dystopian universe in which humanity has made itself dependent on technology. It utilizes mixed media technologies to explore the concepts of dependency on technology, isolation from direct experience and agency.
